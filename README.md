# Atlas-game-version01
Simple console printed Atlas game to start with. 

Language: python (version 3.0 and above)

Download the other 5 files (main-game-v01.py, countries.txt, highscore.txt, alive progress.whl & pyfiglet.whl) and put them all in a new FOLDER on your device. Then run "main-game-v01.py" on your python idle. I have attached all the necessary files (including libraries).

Libraries used in this game:

1) random
2) time
3) alive progress 
4) pyfiglet

My future ideas for this project:

1) Version 2 of this game will have audio effects, background music and updated database.
2) Version 3 of this game will have proper game interface and you will be able to download the game in apk and exe formats.

Sidenote:

I have designed this game as per the screen dimensions of my mobile phone (i have attached a screenshot of how the game looks on my phone https://github.com/notsanidhyak/Atlas-game-version01/this_is_how_the_game_looks_on_my_phone.png is how the game looks on my phone.png). So the lines and the spacing may look little bit disorganized on your device. Version 3 of this game will solve this issue.

Hope you like it
Thank you :)
